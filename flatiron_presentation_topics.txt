Critical points to discuss during the presentation:

- highlight changes h/h as calculated and displayed on plots
- highlight possible causes for the changes we are seeing
- highlight the business/qualitative aspects to the business and how it can inform historical performance and next steps.... don't bring up the insurance perspective
- highlight the path I believe is the most likely explanation and show why
- make recommendations


select slides/figures and export these
draft text
qualify the recommendations

emphasize all trends: both increases and decreases
Need to produce some overall stats (across periods)
HIgh level stats compared period-period

Clear concise introduction to the research
- macro stats: basis of insrer, denial type and service line
There was also a process implemented HIgh level stats compared period-period


Make a proportions table for service line and denial type... if the proportions stayed flat h/h, then we know that the firm targeted the service line; if not, then we know they targeted particular denial types.
